# Encipher
Encipher is C# Windows Form App where you can securely store your user login information offline. Encipher incorporates 
Google Authenticator to login into the program so no password is ever needed to be remembered.
Encipher creates a local database where it encrypts the data into AES 256 bit encryption and stores it onto the database.
